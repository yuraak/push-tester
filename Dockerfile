WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies (including dev dependencies needed for the build)
RUN npm ci

# Copy the rest of the app source code

# Step 2: Run the app using Node in production mode
FROM node:20

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json from the build stage

# Expose ports (3000 for frontend, 3002 for proxy)
EXPOSE 3000 3002

# Command to run both the frontend and proxy server
